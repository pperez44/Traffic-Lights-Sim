# Traffic Light Simulation

This was the final project for my Computer Organization and Assembly class. 
It‚Äôs a simple traffic light cycle using assembly on an Arduino (ATmega328P). 
There's also a pedestrian crosswalk feature that interrupts the cycle when you press a button.

## What it does
- Traffic lights go through the standard red ‚Üí green ‚Üí yellow cycle.
- If the pedestrian button is pressed, it interrupts the cycle and runs a pedestrian light (blinking LED) so people can "cross."
- After that, it goes back to the normal cycle.

## Tech used
- AVR Assembly
- Arduino Uno
- LEDs and a push button
